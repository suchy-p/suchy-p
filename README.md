- 👋 Hi, I’m Patryk  
- 👀 I’m interested in: history (right now mostly second half of XIXth century), sci-fi and fantasy (but for me orbital bombardment always beats fireball), a bit of retro gaming (90's–00's), from time to time a bit of Gunpla modeling, coding is also fun
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai), want to apply this knowledge to [IBM repo](https://github.com/suchy-p/IBM-Index-and-Bibliography-Maker) and see what happens
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: something with Python, where I could learn or just be of some use
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail suchodolskipatryk@gmail.com is fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Godzilla fan, saw every film at least once, except "Godzilla Minus One". How did it happen? I don't know
